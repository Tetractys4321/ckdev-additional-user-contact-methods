This is a simple plugin that adds additional contact methods to the WordPress user's profile page.

Currently it supports the following options:

Facebook
Twitter
Google+
LinkedIn

The administrator can set what options are available to users under the Settings > Additional User Contact Method menu.
These options are stored into the wp_options table which is updated when the admin changes which options available.

This plugin is not theme specific and only deals adds the selected contact methods data to the wp_options table.



The plugin was built using the following WordPress documentation source...
